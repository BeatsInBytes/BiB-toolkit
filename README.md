# Beats in Bytes Toolkit

> A comprehensive toolkit for musical analysis. These tools and scripts use music encoding files such as midi, xml, and kern to perform complex analysis - **currently only kern analysis is supported**.


## Installation
Coming to homebrew on completion...
### Git
Install with git:
```bash
git clone this && cd this
make
make install
```

## Usage
A variety of options are available, but a complete analysis can be provided by simply running `bib` on a file (or list of files).  
For more control and options, see the below list of flags.

## Dependencies
A portion of UI for the analysis depends on a graphing program - see [k-vernooy/clplot](https://github.com/k-vernooy/clplot). This will be automatically installed when needed.

## Compatibility
macOs and (possibly) linux compatible, though it hasn't been tested on the latter.
